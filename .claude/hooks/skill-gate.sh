# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Edit|Write|MultiEdit): BARRIER, not a warning.
# Blocks an edit/write inside a skill-owned domain (e.g. src/shared/api, src/shared/stores)
# until the routed Skill has been invoked this turn. This is the enforcement that the
# PostToolUse detect-bypass.sh could never be: detect-bypass fires AFTER the tool ran and
# only writes to stderr; this fires BEFORE and can deny, so rule-following no longer depends
# on how willingly a given model reads stderr warnings -- it is model-agnostic.
#
# Contract (verified against official Claude Code hook docs):
#   stdin JSON: tool_name, tool_input{file_path,...}, source fields.
#   To DENY: stdout {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse",
#       "permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":<shown to the model>}}.
#   $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR available. Matcher matches the TOOL NAME.
#
# Fail-open: any error / missing routing / unparseable input exits 0 (allow). A buggy
# guard must never block real work -- it only blocks the one specific, verified condition.
# Domains gated: only path-deterministic ones (api, slice). Unistyles is NOT gated here
# because styles live next to components -- a path glob would false-positive; it stays on
# the trigger-based detect-bypass.sh nudge.
#
# Two passes:
#   1. Skill-gate (original): edit in a skill-owned editGlob with the Skill not yet invoked -> deny.
#   2. Rule-gate (ruleGates in skills-routing.json): edit matches a gate by path OR the user
#      prompt matches its promptTriggers, and the gate's rule file was not Read this turn
#      (turn-reads.json) -> deny until it is. Covers rule files that carry no skill body
#      (e.g. domains-glossary.md) and so were never enforced before an edit.
