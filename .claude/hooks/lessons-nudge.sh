# Stop hook: discipline nudge for the lessons-learned loop.
#
# Why this exists: the lessons promotion path (.claude/CLAUDE.md "Lessons promotion path")
# only fires if I actually append to lessons-learned.md. That has been pure discipline, and
# discipline under context pressure is exactly what slips. A Stop hook cannot read my mind to
# know "I caught a mistake" -- there is no machine event for that. But there IS one precise,
# low-false-positive signal already captured this turn: turn-bypass-warned.flag, set by
# detect-bypass.sh when a skill trigger fired and the skill was NOT invoked. A skill-bypass is
# very often the moment a lesson should be recorded (wrong domain, missed rule). So: if that
# flag exists this turn AND lessons-learned.md was not modified this turn, remind -- once.
#
# Deliberately narrow: keyed on the bypass flag, not on edits-happened or prompt keywords,
# because those produce noise that trains me to ignore the nudge. Stop hooks only write stderr
# (no deny), so this is a visible reminder, not a barrier -- which is the right strength for a
# signal that is suggestive, not certain.
#
# Contract: stdin JSON (session info, transcript_path). $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR available.
# Fail-open: any error exits 0 with no output.
