# SDD Lifecycle

The active front door for the spec-driven pipeline. On a build request, classify where it enters the chain, then drive the chain **one phase at a time, stopping for the user's explicit approval after every phase**.

**Core principle:** the phase *order* is already forced by each skill's own hand-offs — that is not what this skill adds. What it adds is the **gate between phases: advance only on the user's explicit approval of the phase you just finished.** A design sign-off is NOT blanket approval for the spec, the plan, or "start coding". Each artifact is approved on its own.

This skill owns the **cross-phase gate + the controls** — it does NOT restate what each phase skill does; it routes into them. Project-agnostic: it names no stack, path, or command.

## When to use / when not

- Use when the user wants the whole gated pipeline run on a non-trivial change.
- **Do NOT run the pipeline for a one-line or cosmetic change** — the overhead is wrong-sized; make the change directly (still test-first).
- A bare "build X" with no lifecycle request enters the chain at `grilling` directly. Invoke this skill only when the user wants the full orchestrated, gated run.

## Entry classification (where the chain starts)

Route the input to its entry phase, then gate from there:

| Input on the table | Enters at |
| --- | --- |
| A ticket ID or URL | `resolving-requirements` |
| A fuzzy idea / "I want to add X" | `grilling` |
| An approved design, no spec yet | `writing-specs` |
| A half-done feature (code, no current spec) | `writing-specs` (reverse-engineer the spec) |
| A spec exists, no plan | `writing-plans` |
| An approved plan | `pre-implementation-protocol` |

(`spec-drift-audit` is not an entry — it is the terminal verify phase, below. A standalone audit of already-shipped code *outside* a full run invokes `spec-drift-audit` directly.)

## The phases

`resolving-requirements → grilling → writing-specs → writing-plans → pre-implementation-protocol → (inline-driven-development \| subagent-driven-development) → spec-drift-audit`. Each phase produces one artifact and hands to the next; invoke the phase skill — do not re-derive its work here.

The chain **closes** on `spec-drift-audit` — the **verify** phase: after implementation and before the commit, it checks the shipped code against the approved spec. It is the terminal step, never an entry into a build.

## Progress list

Before the first phase, seed a single harness task list with these **canonical 7-phase items**, in order — entry phases ahead of the classified start marked skipped, never dropped:

```text
1. Resolve requirements (resolving-requirements)
2. Grill into a design (grilling)
3. Write the spec (writing-specs)
4. Write the plan (writing-plans)
5. Readiness check (pre-implementation-protocol)
6. Implement test-first (inline-/subagent-driven-development)
7. Audit against the spec (spec-drift-audit)
```

Then drive its statuses as you advance. The status discipline — exactly one `in_progress`, the create-or-update logic, and the binding of `completed` to the user's explicit approval — is in [phase-task-visualization](../../../.claude/rules/common/phase-task-visualization.md). An item turns `completed` only when the user approves that phase's artifact, so the list mirrors the gate below rather than running ahead of it.

## The gate — the load-bearing rule

After each phase: **present its artifact, then STOP.** Advance to the next phase only on the user's explicit approval of *that* artifact. Never auto-advance — not when confident, not because the previous phase was approved, not because the next phase is "just an elaboration". One approval unlocks exactly one phase. Present that approval choice as archetype A per [interactive-gates](../../../.claude/rules/common/interactive-gates.md).

If a later phase reveals an earlier artifact is wrong, **loop back**: return to that phase, fix it, and re-advance with fresh approval — do not patch forward.

## Controls

- **`skip <phase>`** — its artifact already exists on disk; verify it is current, then start at the next phase.
- **`from <phase>`** — begin mid-chain (e.g. a plan is ready → `from pre-implementation-protocol`).
- **`redo <phase>`** — a later phase exposed a defect upstream; return, fix, re-advance from there.

## Execution-mode fork

After the plan is approved and before execution, present the inline-vs-subagent choice as archetype **B** per [interactive-gates](../../../.claude/rules/common/interactive-gates.md): `inline-driven-development` (coupled tasks / small plan) vs `subagent-driven-development` (independent tasks). This is a presentation point only — the chosen flow owns the execution.

## Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "The design was approved — that covers the spec and plan too." | Each artifact is approved on its own. Design sign-off is not blanket consent. |
| "I'm confident; advancing saves a round-trip." | The user owns each artifact. Confidence is not consent. |
| "The spec/plan are just elaborations of the approved design." | Elaboration is exactly where scope silently drifts — that is what the gate catches. |
| "It's faster to run the chain end-to-end." | A wrong spec caught at its gate is cheap; caught after code it is a rewrite. |
| "The order is obvious, so I don't need to stop." | The order being obvious is *why* this skill isn't about order — it's about the stop. |

## Red Flags — STOP

- Advancing to the next phase without an explicit approval of the current artifact.
- Treating the design sign-off as approval for the spec, the plan, or starting code.
- Running the full pipeline for a one-line / cosmetic change.
- Restating a phase skill's internals instead of invoking it.
- Auto-advancing "because the chain order is obvious".

## Integration

- **Routes into** the chain skills; each phase skill owns its own work and its own hand-off to the next. This skill adds only the cross-phase approval gate, the entry classification, and the controls — it replaces no phase.
- **Per phase:** hand to the entry skill for the classified input, let it produce its artifact, gate on approval, then advance.
- **Terminal:** the pipeline ends at `spec-drift-audit`; the human owns the commit.
