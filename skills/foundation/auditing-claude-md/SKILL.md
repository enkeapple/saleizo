# Auditing CLAUDE.md

Verify the two CLAUDE.md files — the root entry point and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` operating manual — against the current repo AND against each other, report the drift, then correct it. **A wrong CLAUDE.md is worse than none**: a stale command or a dead pointer misleads every session that trusts it.

**Every concrete thing these files assert — a command, a file/folder path, a stack version, a routed skill/command, a cross-link — is a structural claim, and editing CLAUDE.md is editing code.** Re-verify each against the repo this session; a command not in `package.json`, a pointer to a missing folder, a stack version that disagrees with the lockfile are drift, not detail. Memory is not evidence.

Mirrors `auditing-domain-rules` (same discipline, applied to the foundational rules). Pairs with `bootstrapping-claude-md` (which creates these files).

## When to use

- Periodic maintenance, especially after dependency bumps, script renames, folder moves, or adding/removing skills.
- A command or pointer "looks off", or the two files seem to disagree.

## When NOT to use

- The files don't exist yet → `bootstrapping-claude-md`.
- Auditing `.claude/rules/` content → `auditing-domain-rules`.

## Process

1. **Enumerate every concrete claim across BOTH files.** List each: command (tables + checklist verification rows), file/folder path & cross-link, stack/version claim, routed skill or slash command, and any named protocol.
2. **Verify each against the repo this session.** `package.json`/Makefile/CI for commands; the filesystem for paths/folders; the lockfile for versions; the skill/command registry for routing targets. Do not stop at the obvious one — the unrunnable checklist row is usually the one you'd skim. Also flag **bypass wording**: a non-negotiable or pointer that tells the agent to `append`/`Edit` a skill-owned artifact directly (e.g. `lessons-learned.md`, a plan file) — check the routing registry for a skill that owns that workflow; if one exists, the direct-edit instruction bypasses it and is drift.
3. **Run the cross-file consistency pass.** The root and the manual must agree: same pipeline name/vocabulary, same Role/position, same commands, no contradiction. The root stays a thin index — governance that is duplicated in both files is drift waiting to happen; it should live in the manual and be pointed to.
4. **Classify each finding:** Confirmed / Stale doc (repo right, doc outdated) / Code drift (doc states an intended rule the repo violated — fix may be the *code*) / Broken (command/path/skill that resolves to nothing) / Inconsistent (the two files disagree).
5. **Decide direction before editing:** Stale/Broken → fix the doc. Inconsistent → pick the single source (usually the manual) and make the other point to it, don't duplicate. Code drift → surface as a decision, don't silently rewrite the doc to bless it.

## Report format

Produce a report before editing (see [references/audit-report-example.md](references/audit-report-example.md)):

1. **Claims checked** — table: claim → file → what the repo shows → status.
2. **Cross-file consistency** — pipeline / Role / commands / pointers agree? list mismatches.
3. **Summary** — counts per status.
4. **Decisions needed** — each Code-drift / ambiguous-source item as a choice.

## Apply the corrections

- **Stale / broken:** fix the specific command/path/version — surgical, not a rewrite. Re-verify each fix.
- **Inconsistent:** consolidate to the single source; make the other a pointer.
- **Code drift:** apply only what the user chose.
- Keep the root a thin entry point; keep Confirmed claims untouched.

## Red Flags — STOP

- "I read it, looks fine" — no per-claim verification = the audit didn't happen.
- Checking only the claim that was pointed out, leaving the rest of both files unverified.
- Auditing one file and ignoring the other, or skipping the cross-file consistency pass.
- Assuming every disagreement means the doc is stale — the repo can have drifted from an intended rule.
- Fixing a drifted command by duplicating governance into the root instead of pointing to the manual.
- "I remember this script exists" — verify against `package.json`, or it is unverified.
- A non-negotiable/pointer instructing a direct `append`/`Edit` to a skill-owned artifact (e.g. `lessons-learned.md`, a plan file) when the repo HAS the skill that owns it — that bypasses the skill; the manual must route through the `Skill` tool.

## Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
| -------- | --------- |
| "The commands look right." | Looks ≠ runs. Check each against `package.json`; the stale one is the row you'd skip. |
| "Only the flagged line is wrong." | Nothing flags the rest. The audit covers every command, path, and pointer in both files. |
| "Repo changed, so the doc is stale." | Maybe — or the repo drifted from an intended rule. Decide direction; don't auto-bless the code. |
| "The two files say it differently, I'll leave both." | Two copies drift apart — that's how they got here. One source; the other points to it. |
| "It says append to the lessons log — that's how capture works." | If the repo has a lessons-capture skill, a direct append bypasses it (skips cause-tag/promotion discipline). The manual must route capture through the `Skill` tool; flag the direct-edit wording as drift. |
