# Bootstrapping README

Generate a human-facing **skills catalog** inside a managed block in `README.md`, sourcing every row from skill frontmatter on disk. The catalog is the GitHub landing page a browser reads — distinct from the agent-facing `CLAUDE.md`.

**Every row is derived, never hand-written.** The full derivation — ROOT discovery, category, the description algorithm, ordering, the marker block — is the [catalog-derivation contract](./references/catalog-derivation.md); follow it verbatim. A hand-curated catalog drifts and cannot be audited; a derived one regenerates identically and `auditing-readme` can check it.

Pairs with `auditing-readme`, which checks the block this skill writes for drift.

## When to use

- A skills-bearing repo (skills as `SKILL.md` files with frontmatter) has no README catalog, or only a hand-written stub.
- You added/renamed skills and want the catalog regenerated from disk.

## When NOT to use

- The catalog exists and you only want to know if it drifted — that is `auditing-readme`.
- A consumer app repo with no skills tree — there is nothing to catalog.

## Process

1. **Discover.** Resolve ROOT and glob every `SKILL.md` under it ([catalog-derivation](./references/catalog-derivation.md) → Definitions). Read each one's frontmatter `name` and `description`.
2. **Derive each row** — its link and description per [catalog-derivation](./references/catalog-derivation.md) → DESCRIPTION; group by category and order alphabetically per → ORDER.
3. **Build the block** — the marker pair, the generated-by comment, `###` per category with its bullet list (or one flat bullet list). Each item is `- [<name>](<link>) — <description>` in standard GitHub-Flavored Markdown (a blank line before and after each list). See [assets/readme-block-example.md](./assets/readme-block-example.md).
4. **Write it in, never over prose.** No README → create `# <repo>` H1 + `## Skills` + the block. README without markers → insert the block under a `## Skills` heading. README with markers → replace only the content between them. Everything outside the markers (intro, install, badges, license) is untouched.
5. **Stop on an ambiguous file state** — see Edge cases; never guess past it.

## Edge cases

Handle exactly as the [catalog-derivation contract](./references/catalog-derivation.md) → Edge cases states:

- **Malformed/duplicate markers** → refuse to edit, report the file state; do not guess where the block belongs.
- **Duplicate `name`** → error naming both paths; do not merge.
- **Missing/empty `name` or `description`** → a `malformed frontmatter: <path>` row, not a crash.
- **Zero skills under ROOT** → an empty block with a `<!-- no skills found -->` comment.

## Red Flags — STOP

- Writing a description by hand instead of deriving it from frontmatter.
- Rendering the catalog as a table or re-adding a kind column instead of the derived bullet list.
- Overwriting prose outside the markers, or inserting a second `## Skills` section.
- Editing a README whose markers are malformed instead of refusing and reporting.
- Inventing a skill, or omitting one the glob found, so the block disagrees with disk.
