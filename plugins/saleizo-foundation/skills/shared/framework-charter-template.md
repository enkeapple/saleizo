# Framework Charter Template

The charter governs *how* to work in this repo, regardless of module. It is concrete — grounded in this repo's real commands, patterns, and failure modes — not generic advice. Every command and pattern named is one you confirmed by reading the repo.

**This is a strict contract, not a loose shape.** The generated file MUST reproduce the frontmatter and the section set and order below, verbatim. `auditing-glossary` validates a live charter against this same file — a missing frontmatter block, or a renamed/added/dropped section, is drift it will flag and fix. The specifics inside each section are the consumer repo's; the shape is fixed.

# Framework Rules

Stack-agnostic process rules: how to approach work, verify it, and avoid this repo's common failure modes. They apply regardless of which module you touch. Domain rules live alongside under `.claude/rules/`.

## Implementation Protocol

Before any implementation:

1. Read the full request. Identify the domain concepts and the layers touched.
   <!-- If the repo has a glossary, add: "If the request mentions <ambiguous terms>, read the glossary FIRST and name the domain." -->
2. Scan every layer the change touches (<layers> — e.g. screen → hook → api → store → navigation). Classify each: NONE / PARTIAL / FULL.
3. Design contracts AS CODE, not prose — for every contract the change touches, write the concrete type / endpoint shape / state delta / param list. If you can't write it as code yet, the task isn't understood: grep/read until you can.
4. Think through behaviour: 1 happy path + the edge cases (empty / error / in-flight; for mutations: idempotency, partial success).
5. Only then write code, in dependency order. For PARTIAL, implement only the missing layers.

If genuinely ambiguous: stop, ask ONE question. Phases are not optional; abbreviate for trivial fixes, never skip.

## Suspicion Protocol

Run every phase presuming something is wrong. After each phase, check for this repo's recurring failure modes:

1. **Missed code** — searched only the obvious name. Grep 2 naming variants (verb/noun swap, abbreviation, legacy prefix); re-scan if any hit.
2. **Shortcut / silent cut** — re-read the request bullet by bullet; each bullet must point to a line in the plan/code. A bullet with no pointer is a silent cut.
3. **Hallucinated symbol** — every API/hook/route/constant referenced is verified by grep/read this session, not from memory.
4. **Test passes for the wrong reason** — for any new test, invert the expectation once and confirm it fails; revert.
5. **Unverified structure claim** — every "X has Y / exports Z / endpoint accepts P" is backed by a read this session, or labelled `(unverified)`.

If suspicion confirms a defect: STOP, name the failure mode, go back one phase — do not patch silently.

## Zero-hallucination rule

No structural claim about the repo without a read this session. Trigger phrases that mean STOP-and-read: "by analogy…", "it should be similar…", "I assume the slice has…", "probably accepts…". This binds plans, code, questions, and chat equally. **Editing a rule doc is editing code** — every symbol/path/anchor in a `.claude/rules/*.md` is a structural claim, re-verify before writing it.

## Evidence-Based Verification

After any code change, run and SHOW the output of the repo's real checks (no "should pass"):

- `<typecheck-cmd>`
- `<lint-cmd>`
- `<test-cmd>` (if none, state there is no suite and what you verified manually)
- For UI changes: exercise it via `<ui-exercise-method>` or say explicitly you couldn't.

## Question Discipline

Don't ask what the repo or rules already answer. Before asking, check: is it in the code (grep/read)? in `.claude/rules/`? a technical sub-variant? If yes → decide, justify in one line, proceed (pick the closest existing pattern, smallest diff, no shared-interface change). Reserve questions for genuine product/business decisions with no precedent.

## Strict rules (what `auditing-glossary` enforces against this file)

1. **Frontmatter is required** — a leading `--- … ---` block with a non-empty `description` and `paths: ['**/*.md']`. A charter that starts directly with `#` is non-conformant.
2. **Section set and order are fixed** — the H1 title is `# Framework Rules` or `# Framework Charter` (either is conformant; do not flag one for the other), then exactly `## Implementation Protocol` → `## Suspicion Protocol` → `## Zero-hallucination rule` → `## Evidence-Based Verification` → `## Question Discipline`, each heading **verbatim** including the lowercase `rule` in `## Zero-hallucination rule`. These five are the **only** top-level `##` sections — the top-level structure is identical across every repo.
3. **Repo-specific disciplines are `###` subsections, never new top-level `##`.** A real extra discipline (plan-file threshold, repo-specific invariants, batch policy, …) is placed as a `### ` subsection under the closest fixed `##` section — never as a sixth top-level `##`. Dropping or renaming one of the five fixed sections is a defect.

## Notes

- Replace every `<placeholder>` with this repo's real layers, commands, and patterns — the value is in the specifics, not the headings.
- Keep it about *process*; concrete stack conventions (styles, naming, file layout) belong in their own rules, cross-linked.
- The suspicion failure modes should reflect the failures THIS repo actually hits — add or drop modes based on the lessons log (`writing-lessons`) if one exists.
