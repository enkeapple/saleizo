# Audit Report — filled example

A neutral reference for the REQUIRED fixed shape `auditing-conflicts` produces: classes 1–9 in order, each finding in the locked shape, an explicit zero-findings line per clean class, a one-line Summary, then the C-drift picker. Three cases are shown — a real conflict (Class 7), a *false* conflict the judgment layer downgrades (Class 6), and clean classes.

# Cross-Artifact Conflict Audit — saleizo marketplace

## Findings   (classes 1–9 in order; findings within a class sorted by severity)
Class 1 (trigger collision): no conflicts found
Class 2 (responsibility overlap): no conflicts found
Class 3 (broken hand-off): no conflicts found
Class 4 (contradictory instructions): no conflicts found
Class 5 (rule-vs-rule): no conflicts found
Class 6 (duplicate canonical-source):
F-002 · Class 6 · Severity Info  (downgraded by judgment — see rationale)
Title:    git-conventions and CLAUDE.md both speak to the git boundary
Evidence: .claude/rules/common/git-conventions.md "Canonical Source — Do Not Duplicate"
          .claude/CLAUDE.md → "Git boundary"
Why:      Both touch the same concern (git autonomy / commit rules) — the mechanical layer flags a
          duplicate-ownership candidate.
Judgment annotation (downgrade → Info): NOT a real conflict — git-conventions.md carries an explicit
          "Canonical Source — Do Not Duplicate" cross-reference deferring the boundary to CLAUDE.md and
          owning only the *format* conventions. Mechanical finding retained, visible, severity Info.
Disposition: accept (cross-reference already present)
Class 7 (rule-vs-skill contradiction):
F-001 · Class 7 · Severity Low
Title:    grilling's "multiple-choice" interview framing reads as the picker, but the rule reserves the picker for gates
Evidence: plugins/saleizo-core/skills/grilling/references/interview-playbook.md:19 "Prefers a small **multiple-choice** set over open-ended where possible."
          .claude/rules/common/interactive-gates.md:22 "Do NOT add a picker where the choice is **agent-derivable** … or **already conversational**."
Why:      "multiple-choice" (interview content framing) and "picker" (the gate tool) are not distinguished,
          so a reader applies the picker tool to a conversational interview question — inconsistent UX.
Disposition: amend interview-playbook.md:19 to split "multiple-choice framing (prose)" from "the picker tool
             (gates only, per interactive-gates)" → writing-skills (behavioral lane, test-first)
Class 8 (routing/invocation invariant): no conflicts found
Class 9 (orphan reference): no conflicts found

## Summary
- Findings: 2 (High 0 · Medium 0 · Low 1 · Info 1) · Shortlisted pairs: 6 · Dropped pairs: 41

## Decision
- `Apply recommended` → run each finding's disposition in its lane: F-001 via `writing-skills` (behavioral, test-first); F-002 `accept` (the cross-reference already resolves it).
- `Adjust per-finding` → walk F-001, F-002 one by one.
- `Stop` → take no action now.
